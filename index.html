              An Eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in her
              talons and made off with it to her nest. A Jackdaw saw the deed,
              and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and
              strong enough to do as the Eagle had done. So with much rustling
              of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftly on the back of
              a large Ram. But when he tried to rise again he found that he
              could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And so
              far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly noticed
              he was there.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Shepherd saw the fluttering Jackdaw and at once guessed what
              had happened. Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its
              wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children.

              An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak. She seemed very
              sad and drooping for an Eagle. A Kite saw her.
              <br />
              <br />
              "Why do you look so woebegone?" asked the Kite.
              <br />
              <br />
              "I want to get married," replied the Eagle, "and I can't find a
              mate who can provide for me as I should like."
              <br />
              <br />
              "Take me," said the Kite; "I am very strong, stronger even than
              you!"
              <br />
              <br />
              "Do you really think you can provide for me?" asked the Eagle
              eagerly.
              <br />
              <br />
              "Why, of course," replied the Kite. "That would be a very simple
              matter. I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as
              if it were a feather!"

              The Eagle accepted the Kite immediately. But after the wedding,
              when the Kite flew away to find something to eat for his bride,
              all he had when he returned, was a tiny Mouse.
              <br />
              <br />
              "Is that the Ostrich you talked about?" said the Eagle in disgust.

              "To win you I would have said and promised anything," replied the

              The Serpent and the Eagle

              A Serpent had succeeded in surprising an Eagle and had wrapped
              himself around the Eagle's neck. The Eagle could not reach the
              Serpent, neither with beak nor claws. Far into the sky he soared
              trying to shake off his enemy. But the Serpent's hold only
              tightened, and slowly the Eagle sank back to earth, gasping for
              breath.
              <br />
              <br />
              A Countryman chanced to see the unequal combat. In pity for the
              noble Eagle he rushed up and soon had loosened the coiling Serpent
              and freed the Eagle.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Serpent was furious. He had no chance to bite the watchful
              Countryman. Instead he struck at the drinking horn, hanging at the
              Countryman's belt, and into it let fly the poison of his fangs.

              The Countryman now went on toward home. Becoming thirsty on the
              way, he filled his horn at a spring, and was about to drink. There
              was a sudden rush of great wings. Sweeping down, the Eagle seized
              the poisoned horn from out his savior's hands, and flew away with
              it to hide it where it could never be found.
